Hey! I got a busted ass here and I don't see anyone kissing *it*!
My God. I'm overcome with feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
Now I'm worried I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time, I feel relieved I'm cuter than her.
This time, I miss Nibbler, and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
Aw, I just made myself feel bad.
Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
Only one way to find out...
There. This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable.
Hey. What are you doing with my head?
Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
Aw, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
Listen to me, Leela. I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you.
Bigger! Bigger!
Don't stop now! You need pants to go with that outfit!
Bender is back! I'll save you, Nibbler!
Stupid can opener! You killed my father, and now you've come back for me!
You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
Eh.
Well, step one, I had to lift the lid. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?
I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.
Really?
I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream.
Of course I do, right now I feel sorry for you.
Yeah, I mean one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye?, you ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady.
Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler
So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget!
That'll take care of those annoying rats, now to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me!
Uh-oh jealousy!
You think you're so hot!
The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
You think you're so hot!
The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen.
Well, we're boned.
You know its funny...
Your wiener! haha
Rrrrr... it's so cold, my processor is running at peak efficiency!
I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do.
Not so neutral now, are you, Sweden?
We're back, baby!
Hasta la vista, meatbag!
Who the hell is he?
Hang on, Scruffy!
Sorry, it's not quite finished.
Let's just say he might not make it to "The Last Supper".
I don't blame myself. I blame all of you!
It ain't easy. It just proves how great I am.
Here's your Guttenberg Bible, masters, plus the Colonel's secret recipe: "Chicken, grease, salt".
Awww, I lost him, people will call me a failure.
Others however will call me the World's Sexiest Killing Machine, that's fun at parties.
Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth.
We could sing.
What do ya got there, numbers?
Follow that guy. Ther's an extra hundred in it for you, if you follow him that close that you run him over.
I accept this Nobel Peace Prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. Skoal!
That's a complete load!
Where would the professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there! Ha ha ha ha!
Got a hot, steaming batch right here.
Ah, keep the change, buddy.
Your social security check's bounced. Stuff cost more than it used to. Young people use curse words.
Well, life goes on... except for you. Ha ha ha ha!
You bastard!
Funny, funny stuff.
They say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here is the professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster.
Uh, me no speak-a the English.
No, we're not, you little bedwetter. Oops! I'm sorry.
How 'bout a few words, Professor?
I said words.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!
Oh, Elzar, everything is so good!
Yes, sir! Good one, sir!
And now, a man who needs no introduction.
Fry, get up there!
I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor, then I hope he did die.
Impending para un bending!
Sounds boring.
That's a complete load!
But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
Ah, hell - I mean, heck.
Don't worry, I won't be too good or too evil again. From now on I'll just be me.
I don't know. Do you think you could survive a seven-hundred foot fall?
Hey. What kind of party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
Hey. Do I preach at you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No!
Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Give me all the juice you got!
I believe that qualifies as ill, at least from a technical standpoint.
No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good-old mineral oil.
Ahh. Functional.
No! Don't come in!
Just tell me why!
There must be robots worse than I.
Then please let me explain: / My crimes were really boyish pranks.
Ah, don't blame me, blame my upbringing!
I can't believe someone sent an intergalactic spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering, anyway?
Where are we delivering it?
Another job well done.
Well, if jacking on will make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it.
In the name of all that is good and logical, we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic, one-zero-zero-zero-one-zero-one-zero-one-zero-one-zero-one...
... zero-one-zero-one-one-zero-zero-one... two. Amen.
Ah, crap! Singing! Mind if I smoke?
Hey. Do I preach at you when you're lying stoned in the gutter?
I think that qualifies as ill, at least from a technical standpoint.
Too much work. Let's burn it and *say* we dumped it in the sewer.
Yeah, well... I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!
Naw, she'll probably make me do it.
Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know... left, down, rotate sixty-two degrees, engage rotor...
You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to visit the Sexeteria.
Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ahh, screw the whole thing!
Of course not. A girl that fine you gotta romance first.
Better mascots than you have tried.
What do you mean "we", mammal?
Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck.
Hey, look what I won off some tourist's pocket.
Bite my shiny metal ass!
Get it off! Get it off! Oh-oh. How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a... Aaoow!
Don't ever do that! Magnets interfer with my inhibition unit.
Yes. Although a robot would have to be crazy to be a folk singer.
Well, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes, / Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes, / Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun, / Oh, I'll shoot her with my ray gun, / Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes, / When she comes! / I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, / I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, / I'll be blastin' all the humans, / I'll be blastin' all the humans, / I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, / In the world!
One more time!
Yes,
I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna' be a folk-singer...
Well, everyone, prepare to have your guts kicked out by folk singers.
So can I keep the check?
Fry crack corn, and I don't care / Leela crack corn, I still don't care / Bender crack corn, and he is great / Take that, you stupid corn!
I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them, but how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing Spanish. Ooh, wait! That's it! I'll fake it!
Hey, yeah! I could write a song! With real words, not phony ones like 'odelay.'
I'll save me.
What is that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.
For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!
Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.
That is so wrong! You can't melt down broken robots, not right when they're kissing my ass!
You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now.
I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobilized.
That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, "Look at me, world! I am a broken robot!"
Oh, crap! It's a miracle!
Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge!
Why, 'cause I can make annoying noises?
Someone fat get in my way!
What a waste.
Grab a shovel. I'm one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
This is the Brooklyn bound B-train , making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors. Bim-bum!
You're twice the the he ever was.
New York is so burned.
Except for "Sports" by Huey Lewis.
Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place.
There, now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine.
Was it poorly Xeroxed?
Bending's my middle name.
Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodriguez.
Old New York, the city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars.
His legend lives on.
Let's just say I lucked out at the track. Also, I rigged one race.
I got his wedding ring. Sorry ladies I'm taken.
Hey Fry, while I'm down here you want me to smack up the corpse a little?
Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
Si!
Othewise I can't die?
No! I want to live! There's still so many things I don't own!
I got a good vibe from this place. Nice, long dinner table; quiet, well behaved spiders; graveyard adjacent; Yep, this is going to be... Aah!
That painting! The eyes are watching me!
So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall. Although...
Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers whom I always hated!
I need professional help, and damn the expense!
Damn the expense!
No doubt about it. This place must be haunted.
The last *human* ghost. But robot ghosts... Ooooh!
I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it.
I thought I killed you, my best friend.
Hey, that was my last beer! You bastard! I'll kill you!
I hope it was one of my enemies. Those guys suck.
Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this?... Waah-ha-ha! I'm scared!
Yes! Let's stay there tonight!
Oh, man, there's always a catch!
Please. I'm scared
That's what they said about being alive!
You really want a robot for a friend?
Well, all right. But I don't want anyone to think we're robosexual or anything, so if anyone asks, you're my debugger.
No friends.
I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
Are you kidding? I was a star. I could bend a girder to any angle. 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it. 31... But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.
Suicide booths.
Can we have some money, now?
Bite my shiny metal ass!
Shinier than yours, meatbag!
I don't *need* to drink, I can quit any time I want.
The decaying ruins of old New York. Welcome home, buddy.
From now on, I can bend what I want, when I want, who I want.
We can hide in here. It's free on Tuesdays.
Good choice.
New crew? Well, what happened to the old crew?
Dream on, skintube! I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a debender?
I'll have to check my program.
Yep.
Keep 'em to yourself, pops.
Well, it was nice meeting you Fry. I'm gonna go kill myself.
You really want a robot for a friend?
Well, all right, but I don't want anybody thinking we're robosexuals so if anyone asks, you're my debugger.
Hey, everybody! Do the Bender. This move's called the Bender.
You've convinced me life is worth living... by showing me how bad my funeral will suck!
Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
It's what made me me.
Those are waves, jackass! It's supposed to be a river!
Citizens of me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past!
Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land!
Your best is an idiot!
I'm the first one to work. A new low.
There. Now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.
You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this.
I'll tell you who I remember.
Enupsis! Pleotut! Whatsisname! He was the greatest of all.
Aww, you knew my favorite cause of death.
Afterlife? Pfft. If I'd thought I had to go through a whole 'nother life, I'd kill myself right now.
Man, the future's a total craphole, and whoever lives here is a crap-faced sack of crap!
No offense, fellas.
No, thanks.
He was coming right at us! You all saw it!
Fry, hurry up! You're missing the dinosaurs!
That's basically what I do every day.
Yeah, yeah. I can take a hint.
Mmm-hmm.
Time? I can't go back there!
This seems like a nice future. Let's just stay here. We can settle down on that mountain of skulls.
Hey! That place had a gorgeous view of Blood Lake.
Stupid jerks won't let me stay in the good future.
Nyah-nyah, we can go...
Oh, so we can stay in the future you like, but not the future I like? Next!
The other place had a lot of nice things too. Did you even see that mountain of skulls?
Oh no you didn't!
Guys, guys! Hedonismbot is finally settling down and marrying a nice house in the suburbs, but tonight, he's having the girls-gone-wildest bachelor party of all time!
Your loss. Hey, Professor! You're my wingman.
Yes, we have to work together, and not have this fight I was definitely winning.
Hey! Bender the Offender doesn't need YOU! Bender the Offender doesn't need ANYBODY!
Well, obviously I need floozies.
I'll put on my tutu.
Leela, you gotta help me.
Who invited you? Let's just see "All My Circuits: The Movie."
Good point, Bender!
It's benderin' time!
I think you misunderstood the concept of "benderin' time."
I was built ready! Gimme the bell! Gimme the bell!
Did you hear a noise?
Uh, hey, buddy! Yo! You mind taking your head off?
Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
Well, they should have stop making her about halfway through.
Final boarding call for Flight 406, non-stop service to pain!
Now boarding standby passengers...
Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
Fry, throw in the towel! For God's sake, Fry!
I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever! Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine.
Sorry, buddy. Here you go.
Dying sucks butt! How do you living beings cope with mortality?
So what could have caused that leak? A heat fracture, on account of I'm so hot?
Ah, fatal, schmatal! I'll just download a wireless backup copy of me into an equally fabulous body.
There's no backup copy of me?
So if I die...
Looks like things are looking up.
Hey, we're just a stone's throw from Tijuana.
Is it within city limits?
Told you.
He's Mexican, I'm Mexican. Let me handle this.
Si.
Ouch-o!
Oh, no, they've killed me! Put me in my Sunday best and stick me in a box. Now they're lowering me into the cold, cold ground. Oh, here come the worms! Ha ha ha ha!
Nu-uh, because in case you didn't know, I'm a robot.
My backup unit makes a backup copy of me every day, so if something happens to my body, I just download that copy into another body. I'm immortal, baby!
I didn't say I wasn't a drama queen.
You mean your wheelchair?
Stinking bureaucrats. I hate 'em!
Hermes, old buddy!
Time heals all wounds.
His ass-ias is gracias.
Oh, yeah? Maybe that's him in a costume.
Come out of there, or I'll squeeze you out like Tijuana toothpaste.
Well, we're in Tijuana. I wanna live a little.
I'm gonna die! That's the exact opposite of what I want!
He did it!
And he's not looking back at that cool explosion! He's a hero!
No! I sold my body.
Game's over, losers! I have all the money. Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves.
Ahhh, what an awful dream. Ones and zeroes everywhere... and I thought I saw a two.
Pfft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
Yeah, right! What's he gonna do, break my legs?
That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon?
I'm not allowed to vote.
No, convicted felon.
That's what Fry said when we turned on the debate.
It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
Ah, yes. John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters by pledging not to go on a killing spree.
I hocked it.
Same reason you hocked your teeth.
Gimme my body back, ya two-bit thief!
Get a room!
Then lose some weight!
Fry, of all the friends I've had... you're the first.
I hate the people who love me. And they hate me.
Madame, I believe you're mistaken
Wow, that lady's got a huge ass.
Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat-ass.
Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome nutricious alcohol. The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
They make me look cool.
Not enough room? My place is 2 cubic meters and we only take up 1.5 cubic meters. We've got room for a whole nother 2/3rds of a person.
That's right, we want some money - wait, what's this about Fry?
That's right! I'm sober and crazy, and I don't know what I might do!
I don't know what it is yet!
Kill all humans, kill all humans, must kill all hu...
I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
Bath-what?
What room?
What what?
Hey, sexy mama... Wanna kill all humans?
Where are you going to stay?
Yeah, but the rents are outrageous.
This last week with Fry has been great. Beneath his warm, soft exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
In a closet? Oh humans...
I'll say. Whooooo!
That's what she said. Whooooo!
Hey look, Bigfoot! He's back!
Up your face! Ahahahaha.
It's used to it. Woooo!
In this case, small. Woooo!
As usual. Woooo!
Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?
Just like at the movie theater. Wooo!
Fry! Fry, wake up! It's me, Bigface. Come out and groom my mangy fur.
It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this.
Aw, they're so cute when they're scared.
Hey look, it's bigfoot again.
Up your face! Ahahahaha.
In this case, small. Woooo!
Let's face it, comedy is a dead art form. Now tragedy, ha ha ha, that's funny.
Lick my frozen metal ass.
Pffft.
WAHHH.
On the fourth day of Xmas, I stole from that lady/
And a slipper on a shoe tree/
Yep.
You're better off dead, / I'm tellin' you, dude.
No, wait. I know these guys. They got nothing.
I'm plenty generous. What about that time I gave blood.
Some guy's.
No, they fixed it 900 years ago.
I doubt it!
What-mas?
Nothing like a warm fire and a super soaker of fine cognac.
Ah, Xmas Eve. Another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money.
I was God once.
O' cruel fate, to be thusly boned! Ask not for whom the bone bones - it bones for thee.
That galaxy is signaling in binary. I should signal back, but I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is. You speak English?
So do you know I'm going to do something before I do it?
What if I do something else?
Worshipers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.
Make it a double!
Of course they go unheeded! How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
Guys, you'll never believe what happened! First I was God, then I met God!
Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack! He pretty much told me so Himself. Now, come on. If we don't free those monks, no one will.
Ugh! Gageth me with a spoon.
You're with me now! This is the maximum level of being with me!
Convert them?
Is the Space Pope reptilian?
Behold... the Internet!
No it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
Too bad it's a dump.
Each more identical than the last!
I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chat room for everybody... and here it is!
Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: worshipping some low-life jerk.
And here's another one with no eyes.
Behold... the Internet.
No it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
And it pinkens your teeth as you chew.
This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me.
Oh, man. What's the use of living if I can't say ass?
Hey! I didn't blow up. Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass!
Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this whole planet straight to the H-word!
Is he any good?
These balls are making me testy! If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their... Wait a minute, where do you shove things up a ball?
You got it!
Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.
You know, playing you all for chumps?
These balls are making me testy!
They look like dorks!
It's not small?
You're screwier than my Aunt Rita, and she's a screw.
No, I was tellin' you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing - court order.
This is great! My buddy's alive, and his credit cards are valid again! Let's go get hammered!
All those times I said "Kill all humans", I always whispered "except one." Fry was that one. And I never told him so.
Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing.
We live to suck another day.
Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?
Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
I didn't mean you're all fat! Just fatso over there.
Hey, chief. You screwed up. There's nothing in here.
Ho, ho...
Ow!
Well, I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either, but that didn't stop me.
Hey, that guy said to tell you...
This guy's too trustworty. What's his angle?
But Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane.
Santa's right. We need some sort of robot.
Oh, crap! I'm some sort of robot!
Hey, Kwanzaa-bot! Where you off to?
Word!
No, wait! I'm the good Santa! I've got toys at very reasonable prices!
But I come bearing Tri-Ominos!
fasterWhy you selfish little bastards!/Do you want the kids to think that Santa's just a crummy empty-handed jerk?/Then shut your yaps and back to work
I should give you all a beating/but I really have to fly
I'll make you cry, buddy. You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.
Good point... but here's a disturbing reminder: anyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
Okay, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no god and your idiotic human ideals are laughable. Ha ha ha!
Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
Up yours, bimbo!
Cram it, lobster!
Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.
Uh, nothin'!
No, of course not! It was, uh... porno! Yeah, that's it!
Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long...
Pansy.
You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that.
Here it comes.
Thank you, and good night.
I was telling Fry you were dead so that he would cry out the emperor, but you had to spoil it by surviving.
It can, and for all you know, it is.
It's salt with water in it, if that's what you mean.
There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful.
Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.
Whatever.
Yeah, yeah, either one's fine.
m Pop a Poppler in your mouth, when you come to Fishy Joe's / What they're made of is a mystery; where they come from, no one knows / You can pick 'em, you can lick 'em, you can chew 'em, you can stick 'em / If you promise not to sue us, you can shove one up your nose.
I found rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?
Not even sauteed in a little mud?
Philip?
Problem solved. You two fight to the death, and I'll cook the loser.
Work his gut. I like it tender.
Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere.
Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?
Okay, we won't eat you.
Better yet, let's take a whole Benderful.
Great is good, but amazing would be great.
Dooooooo...
Who wants some dolphin?
Not this one. He blew his life savings on lottery tickets.
Hey, oh! You want me to do two things? Eh, I'd call my lawyer if dialing the phone wasn't such a hassle.
Shield your eyes! It's like Edward James Olmos on Imax!
Hi. I'm Bender, this is my robot Bender, and this is my other robot Bender.
I know, right?
Alcohol?
Oooee!
It's like fine cognac with a hint of aged scrotum.
Haven't I done enough already?
Make it zero and you've got a deal.
Both of them? You mean you'll do two things and I only have to do one thing?
Sucker.
Legion of Benders, come unto me! We have one thing to do.
Oh, come on, you lazy jerks! If we all pitch in, we each only have to do one-quintillionth of a thing.
How, by making me look at you?
Augh! Your momma's so ugly!
Yeah, if you're into grey dust.
You're watching Futurama: the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery.
And so I ask you this one question. Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
I read the script, and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
Ah, so now my character has a British accent?
An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
That I, Bender, am perfect for the part.
Antonio here, but you may call me Bender. I've got ants in my butt, and I needs to strut!
Bender must be stopped! I have gone too far. Who does that guy think I am?
Once, when I took those hostages.
Bandidos, eh? This is perfect, because I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent. "I will see Adeeos, Padre. Come, Jesoos, my faithful chee-hua-hua. Tonight we eat some gee-oo-ack-a-mole by del ree-o."
Listen up, everyone! I have a dramatic speech. Cameraman, camera on me! Director, what's my motivation?
Perfect!
Ah, the moment felt right. Call me old-fashioned, but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.
Hey, whose been messing with my radio? This is not alternative rock, it's college rock.
Yep, mind-numbingly interesting.
Well, I love a challenge. Um... no... I've got it. I'm gonna be completely honest with you, Planet Express ship. Those women you saw me with were my accountants.
No one, baby. Lucy Liu is the only woman for Bender.
Of course. Bender is a lone wolf, a solitary eagle...
...and that's why I love him.
That's what makes it so nasty.
So, baby, what'll it be? My place or you?
Fry, in order for me to get busy with maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a 400-ton booty.
Me too...
Oh... I think I got whiplash.
I meant *ass* whiplash!
Being with you guys is the best time I've ever had. Hey, a suicide booth! So long, suckers!
Two hundred thousand and one?
Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat.
Learning is fun.
Hubba-hubba! She is built. In Mexico, I believe.
[m[K Eww!
Pervert.
Halt! Who goes there?
Fry who?
Oh... Now this guy had taste.
But I watch your show! You owe me!
What was the first one again?
I thought that was number two!
Fleeing somewhere?
The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?
The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch, cooked with plenty of "confidence"?
That Twizzler!
Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at. Wait, why'd you stopped eating, master?
If it's chicken, chicken a la king. If it's fish, fish a la king. If it's turkey, fish a la king.
My story is a lot like yours, only more interesting 'cause it involves robots
Then why do I have to be careful?
So that's where my cigar was.
So we're in international waters?
Falcon, this is Blue Raven. The goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested.
Hey, guess what you're accessories to.
Ahoy, mateys. I shanghaied us some hearthy grog.
Arrgh, the laws of science be a harsh mistress.
Leela's right, fishing blows. What do we say we make it interesting? Everyone kick in five bucks.
Now, wasn't that interesting?
Harpoon, my ass.
If I'm not going to catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish.
I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.
Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature... because I love you... not in the way of the ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, and a human loves a dog, and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.
Interesting. No, wait. The other thing. Tedious.
Crappy, ineffective Reaper...
What have I done?
Fry, what's wrong?
But that's a good thing. "Walkin' On Sunshine" sucks noodles.
Fry, what's wrong?
But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
That's impossible!
You had a life before you met me?
Really?
Death to humans!
You humans are afraid of a little robot competition. You would never let a robot on the field.
Yeah, doing crap work. Robots are only working as bat boys, ball polishers and sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?
Zero!
And look who's cleaning up the crap! A human child? I wish!
Admit it, you all think robots are just machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
I never made anyone's life easier, and you know it!
The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
You are?
Well, I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
No, it's inhabited by robots.
Oh, sure. Let the robot do all the work.
Well, I can't do it. It so happens tomorrow is a robot holiday.
Only Robanukah, the two holiest weeks in the robot calendar.
I was not just a blast. It was a celebration of the accomplishments of my past prototypes, which just happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
I like it here. I have wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.
Your basic human is between three and twenty-five feet tall, and is mostly composed of an oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
Sure, why not?
I don't remember ever fighting Godzilla... But that is so what I would have done!
Sure, I can help you, but we might have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil, and by "devil", I mean Robot Devil, and by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.
What up?
Forget it. You can't tempt me.
Hmm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want.
Well, at least I don't have the hiccups any more, what's up?
Wow, your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortune. Hahaha!
It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!
Oh, yeah? Well, bite my shiny, metal...
Ohhh, noooooo!
"The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention." / Now that *is* irony!
Who are you, and why should I care?
And what's your problem?
Memory?
Behold, my hand crafted glory! The technological world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!
I say the world must learn of our peaceful ways... by force!
Oh, merciful Poseidon. Have pity on this mechanical mariner.
Uh-oh.
Curse you, merciful Poseidon!
A working cartridge unit? You guys went obsolete years ago.
I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the - Hey! What's the dilly-o?
But... I destroyed the technology of the world! I ran on the beach and felt the sand beneath my foot cups!
Woof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible - nay, probable - that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?
We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
That's right baby, I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him.
Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that!
Probably not, but I love you!
Online.
This comes as quite a shock. Then again, this is not surprising in the least.
You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Anglelyne.
Hooray! I graduated. Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending.
Sorry I got you sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity.
Of course.
You know we don't!
Hmmm, it should look like this...
... but instead it looks like this.
Who *could* do such a thing? And by that I mean this.
Hey look, Leela. It's that idiotic windbag you slept with.
Evidently not.
It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity...
Aw, crap!
Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission.
Cut it out!
Bite my red-hot glowing ass!
I can't go into battle. I'm a conscientious objector.
You know, a coward.
Single female lawyer / Fighting for her client / Wearing sexy mini-skirts / And being self-reliant. Hey, I'm pretty good.
Okay, everyone! Come and get it!
Bite my red-hot glowing ass!
Wait a minute...
Red-hot glowing ass? I'll be right back.
Ow-ow-ow! Ow-ow-ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
Ohhh yeahhh...
Stay away from our women! You've got metal fever, boy! Metal fever!
Eh, saw it coming.
What is the world coming to? That Fry is a sicko poivert, I tell ya! Dating a robot... it's an attrocimacy!
Ah, geez! Would you stifle there, meatbag?
Who's in charge of this dump?
Listen, you fat internet nerd!
Your company promotes wrong love. If you don't shut down right now, the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassing on about it.
And while you're there, pick me up a few credit card numbers.
Stay away from our women. You've got metal fever, boy. Metal fever.
an, [01;31m[KBender:[m[K Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Oh... your... God!
No, but what do you make of this?
Maybe you can interface with my ass by biting it.
Whoa!
Eh, I dunno.
Vamonos!
Hey, you're not a fem-puter, you're a fem-bot!
But why?
Translation: boring.
Wait, my cheating unit malfunctioned. You gotta' give me a do-over.
Was that before or after you slept with him?
Yeah. Food was good, though.
I can assure you, I hardly know the meaning of the word labor.
And I'd do it again, and maybe even a third time! But that would be it.
Wait a minute. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
Was that before or after you slept with him?
I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
I'm in!
I swear those are prescription. I need them for reading stuff... on the other side of stuff.
I am Bender please insert girder.
I am Bender, please insert girder.
I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!
They're my lucky shades. I got them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing-eye dog was out taking a whiz.
I am Bender. Please insert girder.
I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
And you are outta here!
Yeah. Anyone who misses it will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Fry. Could you go make us some popcorn?
High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
That's no flying saucer. That's my ass!
Fry, stop interfering with history! I don't wanna have to memorize a lot of new kings when I get back.
Amen.
1947 can bite my shiny, metal...
Aaaaaaaahhhh!
So? It's not like you slept with him.
Oh, my God!
A saucy puppet show.
Can do.
You really are too picky.
Hey, yeah.
He's pending for a bending!
I'll do it when we get back.
Bite my colossal metal ass!
There's nothing wrong with murder, so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
Blackmail is such an ugly word. I prefer "extortion." The "X" makes it sound cool.
As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered... what if I was five-hundred feet tall?
I'll tell you, with my final breath. I came here with a simple dream: a dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real seven billion ton robot monster here? Not I. Not... I.
I'm a big robot, and I want a big cereal!
Put it there, pal!
I meant your wallet.
Go, man, go!
Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks, and his arm? Leela, I'm shocked! Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash.
Nooo, it's Fry who's crazy in this one!
Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it.
Mars Vegas, the eternal city.
Rest in hell, Crapville!
I'm so full of luck, it's shootin' out like luck diarrhea.
Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
Lose the Celine Dion tickets and you got yourself a deal!
It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. It's 'cause Leela's a threat. A threat to my reputation~ She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet.
Gracias.
Wait, let me come with you.
Death to humans.
Bender to crew: I have reached the gateway to another universe. I feel awed and strangely humbled by the momentous solemnity of this occasion.
Hey, other universe, bite my shiny metal ass!
Yes. I joined the club I thought was cool. But it turned out all leaguee-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves. Leaguee-weegies.
With what?
Y-you're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
No shklit.
I love you meatbags!
What's the matter? Did someone die or something?
Yes! Nailed it!
Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone!
What should we point it at first?
Wow! Neat! Mind if I try that again?
I am forty percent zinc.
That's no lady.
Hey, bite my shiny metal ass.
Ok, ok. We get the point.
Shut the hell up!
Everybody was doing it... I just wanted to be popular
I can't see anything. Are we boned?
I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
What's that, sonny? You say it'll put some whoopee in my cushion?
My brain is no match for your Von Braun.
Did you see me? History came alive and I killed it!
Once I overclock this processor, I'll be all "You a big dummy, Einstein! Get a haircut!"
Fry?
In here is the only place I'm not. Mwa-ha-ha-ha! Mwa-ha-ha-ha! I amuse myself.
Everytime I burp, a new galaxy is created. Two if I've been eating broccoli.
I have some new elements to create. Better cover your nads. It's about to get non-Newtonian in here.
Woooo!
He's a mad man! A mad man!
As a robot, I can't feel human emotions, and sometimes that makes me sad.
So this is what a human body feels like. Hey, where's my antenna? Oh, here it is. It just moved. But I'm not getting any reception. Maybe if I wiggle it a little...
Woooo!
Wait! As men of science, are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, "Do not judge me, until you have tried my way of life for yourselves."
What's that black cracker?
Yo, old guy. Why do we need to use those tiny microdroids? Can't you just shrink us?
Where are we? The ass?
Who are you?
Then why aren't you fixing the boiler?
It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
We're at finger alert five, people.
You mean Space Tax-achusetts? No chance, judge-pants! We're gonna fight to legalize it right here!
Tell me, have things changed on the outside? Is food finally in pill form? What about pills? Are they in food form?
The truth is often stupid.
Shut up, baby. You love it.
What?
Shut up.
Wait! I'm not in position!
What about on the roof?
What about in the gutter?
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... Oops! Sorry. Force of habit. I support this proposition because I'm in love with a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved.
My dreams are over before they began!
Professor, make a woman out of me.
Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals.
Zoidi-poo...
This outfit makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
Oh! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!
It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
If only somehow, some way...
he and I could drive to Vegas pick up some floozy-bots and void their warranties all night long! Whoo!
Sounds boring.
Yeah, and this beer can is made out of old robots.
Okay!
Mmmm... shorts...
OK! Mmmmmm, shorts.
Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
Ooh! Name it after me!
At least let me defend your honor, and then sully it on the couch.
Hey, whoa! There is no way that baby is mine.
Aw, crap!
I'll call him Ben, after the first half of me, Bender.
That's my bastard!
It called me what?
You can't tell me what my son can and cannot do! You may know what's in his head, but not what's in his heart.
I said shut up!
There's a dam.
But there's a grate.
Damn you, old man!
Too late, this is more fun.
So we can have the diamond?
...And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was... the Windows logo!
It is if you're a laser printer.
Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! I'm sorry. Go on.
Yeah, why is it so important you?
I guess I'll go too, with Leonard's permission.
Thanks a lot, Takei. Now everybody knows.
Uh, can people who hate "Star Trek" leave?
Like putting too much air in a balloon!
What a cheesy effect.
I do!
Yeah, why is it so important to you?
Hey, let's all join the Reform party.
A pickle jar?
Second place? That's a fancy word for losing.
You didn't stick your landing!
Never!
$500, you say?
Hey, let's go join the Reform party.
A pickle jar?
A sausage competition, eh? Sounds like fun on a bun.
Shut up! I said it first!
You're drunk, Fry. This is the elephant detector. I just set it to big and woolly.
Hey, these guys are all right.
Whoa, whoa! I love partying as much as the next fellow, but this is Oktoberfest. Good day to you, sir.
Third place? This is the greatest injustice Germany has ever committed!
Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
No! It's called parenting.
What is it with you kids? Every other day, it's food, food, food.
Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food.
No. The cat shelter's on to me.
OK kids, it's 9:00, you know what that means, Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed.
The grown-ups have to talk
Come on, Ma.
500 bucks.
Is Zapp Brannigan okay?
$600.
You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand that you restore my buttocks to their former glory.
Computer dating. It's like pimping, except you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head"
Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I -
Stupid anti-pimping laws. Well, pay the man!
Shut up, baby, I know it!
Well, my normal fee is $500, but seeing that it's for you, I'm gonna need it in advance.
This looks like a good place to ditch some evidence.
Flexo! What are you doing in a hazardous waste bin?
No one! Your momma! Shut up! Take your pick.
What comes out one end we feed to the other. Also Indian food.
Stop thinking, Fry!
Does it have an app for kising my shiny metal ass?
Ooh!
My what, now?
August 6, 1991.
Give 'em hell, Morbo!
I'm back! Everyone at Kinko's was an idiot, so I brought the original.
Are you senile? There's no way I'm getting in there.
You a big dummy!
That's the great thing about that hand.
Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar! Aww, this is the greatest nanosecond of my life! No, this one is! No, this one. Wait! That one was... slightly worse. Ah! So far so good on this one!
I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
Who are they?
Are they the Robot Mafia?
That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
And maybe someday I won't listen.
Shut up and pay attention to me, Bender! Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here, except perhaps you, Hedonism Bot. But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonism Bot.
This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it! Also, life.
Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself, like poor little Shelly here.
For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell but live a rich inner life. And also... well, you know.
No, it's just... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
Those times I was slightly on my side.
We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
No one insults the turtles!
This may be the end of the banana daquiri as we know it!
... Also life.
You could drop dead. That would show them.
Don't kill me just yet. I think I'm coming down with Stockholm Syndrome... handsome.
Je suis Napoleon! Ha ha ha! No, seriously, I'm not.
Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside you've got the heart of a robot.
Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human.
What?... What?
Uh, fifty-sixish?
Like whale barf.
Because he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.
Ah, Jeez, let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer.
Fry, I've never asked you for anything before, but, if it's not too much trouble, when you get to the ninth round, just let him win.
Oh, so this is suddenly all about you! Sheesh!
Please! He's no different from the rest of you organisms. Shooting DNA at each other to make babies. I find it offensive!
I don't think you realize how rich he really is. In fact, I should put on a monocle.
Yeah! Now, are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
I'm a thing.
Yeah, now are you going to come to the squid fights with us, or sit here wallowing in your pre-historic junk!
I'm a thing...
New? What sweater? I came in with this! I don't know you people!
Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
Eh, I've heard better.
Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
Thank you.
So? It's not like it's the only one we've got.
If it ain't black and white, peck scratch, and fight!
Oh, I can't stay mad at what is essentially me.
Bite my glorious golden ass!
Eh, probably dead. Already dissolving in a bathtub if we're lucky.
I've been married to worse.
Fry's right! Let's kill the captain and order some strippers!
Yeah, what he said! It's a mutiny led by Fry!
String him up!
Aw, yeah!
Bender, Bender, Bender! Bender, Bender, Bender! Bender, Bender, Bender!
Aw, that was the greatest endless bunch of mes I ever met.
500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I can take care of that waste for only $499 and one hundred cents.
Yeah. What are you, chicken?
All right, environment, you've met your match.
Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talking about.
You think robot life is worth less than human life, don't you?
So what's the deal? And I'll take my answer in any form except a song.
A gh-gh-gh-gh-ghost?
Hold on to your dookie. It's about to get spooky.
I'm not an idiot, so yes, absolutely.
That's for sure, not on the measly salary I steal from you every week.
Th-th-that's all you get, chumps!
Byte my 8-bit metal ass. That's byte with a Y.
Have you tried gettin' her pregnant?
Is that some sort of attack mushroom or just a moldy schnauzer?
I'll save you, Professor, Zoidberg and Leela!
Whoops.
Now that's acting. Calculon really Shatnered the hell out of that scene.
So what you're saying is that their souls were stolen?
Hey. You put a one and two zeros in front of that or we pass. Deal.
One hundred dollars.
No batter! No batter!
No batter anymore.
When will man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the dead center of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
Now you know why I used the qualifier "practically".
That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink.
No I didn't. Raise middle finger.
They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to Writing.
No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?
Come on, don't you remember how much I bugged you? Don't you? 'Cause it was a lot. You remember, right?
Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
Thanks. And call me Bender.
Am I the only one sittin' here seein' peanut butter on his face?
Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog.
Of course. I'm a bender. I went to Bending College; I majored in Bending.
Robo-American Studies.
Hmmm... okay, but I'll need ten kegs of beer, a continuous tape of "Louie, Louie," and a regulation two-story panty-raid ladder.
Now I can explain that!
Now I can explain that!
Nine, ten, a big fat hen
The name's Bender.
El Zilcho. Hey, is it too late to change my superhero name?
And have to take my LSATs!
Nine, Ten. A big fat hen. /puffs on his cigar/ The name's Bender!
And you want to defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying, "Does Not Compute"?
Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
You know, like how I live every day.
You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope... Aw!
Ah, buck up, meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything! You have the power! Name it and I'm there! You the man!
Nah.
You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy. Real greasy. You been up all night?
Ah, mighty fine smokable...
What to do, what to do. One 300 dollar hookerbot or 300 one dollar hookerbots?
Say, buddy. Why is this grand cigar so pricey?
I'll give you 300 bucks for it.
Oh, all right. I'll just take these $300 burglar's tools then.
So, uh, what time d'you close tonight?
That professor guy? That crawfish thing? This stinks! I demand a hero's welcome after 72 network episodes!
And by my count, we did 72 primetime network episodes!
And we made exactly 72 network primetime Emmy-winning episodes!
What's wrong, Big Boots?
It's *vortices,* meatbag!
Just tell us what's happening!
Don't worry, Leela - soon we'll be able to look on this and laugh.
Leela, save me! And yourself, I guess... and my banjo... and Fry.
I'm Bender, the lovable rascal!
Yo, Captain Catarats. Why are we stopping here?
Like everything in life, pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending.
When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!
Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hellstorm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.
What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless.
Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civiliza...
I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
Oh my god! I just felt it ferment!
I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an ale, Botweiser if it's a lager.
Ah, beer. So many choices, and it makes so little difference.
Overruled! The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot.
Wah, wah! Baby wants a Zima!
Ahh... I guess if you want to have children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
Umm, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
Ooh, a case of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I do.
Say what?
No liquor? Do svidanya, comrade.
Come look, everyone. I got the dearest presents for Mommy.
I didn't steal them, I bought them.
I love her that much.
That's L.A. for you.
He just won't stop with the social commentary.
A home invasion by a former room-mate.
Yeah. And if you won't give me another chance perhaps you'd give one to...
Og. Gorilla Emperor of Earth.
What is that fat, ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma?
Both!
They're my booties from when I was a kid.
They are bronze.
I'm bored. Let's drink!
I don't know where most of her is, but her tongue's in Zapp's mouth. Whoo, nasty!
Hold on! There's alcohol on this planet. My kegger radar is going crazy.
Aha! Found you! You lose again, you stupid intoxicant.
I'm thinking of buying a yacht to house my thoroughbreds. How am I supposed to do that without smoking a cigar?
That's what I'm calling the yacht.
All right! Time to go clubbin'.
Baby seals, here I come!
More like Tax-a-ffusechets.
That's not an issue for us. We're wildlife.
Yep.
Bite my freshly-molted, blubber-filled ass.
I'm forty percent ass.
Alright! You guys are my new best friends!
Great, you guy are my new best friends!
If there's anything I know about fox hunting, it's everything about it.
What's that weird cat thing?
Stop that tenderizing! Prepare for a benderizing!
They don't look so lucky to me.
You wore the same pants for a thousand years? No wonder they made a run for it.
Get to the point. What does it say about me, Bender?
The world? That's where I live! See, I told you I was in there.
On the count of three, you will awaken feeling refreshed, as if "Futurama" were never cancelled by idiots and then brought back by bigger idiots. One... two...
Yeah, we're back.
Woo! I'll just cut that...
Aww, his anus looks like an asterisk.
Aaand boned.
Can we please go home and die now?
This calls for a party, baby. I'm ordering a hundred kegs, a hundred hookers, and a hundred Elvis impersonators who aren't above a little hooking, should the occasion arise.
You never ask me if I'm okay. I'm feeling a little neglected here.
Shut up!
